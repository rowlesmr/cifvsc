# Configuration

To use the CIF extension, specify the dictionary file paths in your `settings.json`:

```json
  "cifTools.dictionaryPaths": [
    "path/to/dictionary1.dic",
    "path/to/dictionary2.dic"
  ]
```

For DDL1 dictionaries, the recommended minimum files are:
- [cif_core.dic](https://github.com/COMCIFS/DDL1-legacy-dictionaries/raw/refs/heads/main/dictionaries/cif_core.dic)
- [ddl_core.dic](https://github.com/COMCIFS/DDL1-legacy-dictionaries/raw/refs/heads/main/dictionaries/ddl_core.dic)

Additionally, if working with powder diffraction files, include the following:
- [cif_pd.dic](https://github.com/COMCIFS/DDL1-legacy-dictionaries/raw/refs/heads/main/dictionaries/cif_pd.dic)


For DDL2 dictionaries, the recommended minimum files are:
- [cif_core.dic](https://github.com/COMCIFS/cif_core/raw/refs/heads/master/cif_core.dic)
- [ddl.dic](https://github.com/COMCIFS/cif_core/raw/refs/heads/master/ddl.dic)
- [templ_attr.cif](https://github.com/COMCIFS/cif_core/raw/refs/heads/master/templ_attr.cif)
- [templ_enum.cif](https://github.com/COMCIFS/cif_core/raw/refs/heads/master/templ_enum.cif)

Additionally, if working with powder diffraction files, include the following, noting that they are drafts:
- [cif_pow.dic](https://github.com/COMCIFS/Powder_Dictionary/raw/refs/heads/master/cif_pow.dic)
- [multi_block_core.dic](https://github.com/COMCIFS/MultiBlock_Dictionary/raw/refs/heads/main/multi_block_core.dic)

See the [COMCIFS github](https://github.com/COMCIFS) for other available dictionaries.
